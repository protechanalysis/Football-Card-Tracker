## Card Booking Tracker
### Project Overview
#### Offensive Card Booking Tracker for Football Club

### Project Summary
This project aims to track and manage the accumulation of yellow and red cards by players and officials during a competition. Leveraging the FPL API, the system collects data and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. Airflow orchestrates the data pipeline, Docker ensures containerized deployment, and Metabase provides visualization.

#### Project Objectives
- Extract card data from the FPL API and load it into a PostgreSQL database.
- Automate the pipeline with Airflow for periodic updates.
- Use Metabase for visualizing card metrics.
- Deploy the solution in a containerized environment with Docker.
